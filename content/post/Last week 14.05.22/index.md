## Overview

1. Last week I managed to publish 2 posts on my website thanks to the Hugo statistical website generator. **You can see them by going to the post section.**
2. I also managed to do two laboratory work on the subject of "Operating Systems": The Midnight Commander command shell and the VI Text Editor.
