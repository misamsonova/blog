# Introduction
**Scientific programming is a highly oriented programming style for scientific calculations. It is distinguished from other types of programming by the extreme correctness and stability of the final product, the strict separation of the scientific and interface parts, the individuality of algorithms, as well as the predominance of efficiency over versatility.**

Scientific programming is at the heart of any modern global research. All advanced technologies — from quantum computers to space programs — would be impossible without specialists in the field of scientific programming, able to provide scientists with a reliable and accurate tool for making discoveries.
A number of branches of science directly depend on the level of development of scientific programming. So, unmanned vehicles, "smart" control systems for urban and agricultural management, stock exchanges are waiting for their execution; robotics, genetic engineering, artificial intelligence that surpasses human capabilities are waiting for them.

# Specializations

Scientists use various programming languages, the choice of which depends on the type of task and the preferences of the author. Historically, the first high-level programming language is Fortran, it has written many well-established libraries of mathematical statistics and libraries for solving differential equations, which is relevant for economics and biology, respectively.
Python has a simpler syntax, which is also suitable for programming mathematical calculations. Python is used for data processing in mathematics, physics, economics, biology, chemistry and is able to work with some other "scientific" languages: Fortran, C++, C#.
In turn, C# allows programming on the platform.NET, adapt the program to the common language runtime environment (CLR) and accelerate development in the framework of operational scientific sessions.

** Great news - from a huge variety of activities, a programmer-scientist has the opportunity to choose exactly what best suits his abilities and at the same time proceed in this choice only from personal preferences.** Let 's list the main types:

- ALGORITHMS.

Search, sorting, encryption, error detection in communication systems. This area will always attract the greatest attention to the practicality of the problems being solved;

- PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES AND COMPILERS.

This also includes the optimization of existing analogues. This is quite a creative and researchable niche, although the peak of its popularity is already passing.

- ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE.

Everything that lies on the verge of fiction: text, image and voice recognition, semantic text analysis, self-learning neural networks and neural network programming as one of the most attractive and promising areas. It is this area that can offer maximum surprises;

- SUPERCOMPUTER AND QUANTUM THEORY

It is a complex of tasks and concepts that are still beyond our technological and intellectual capabilities.

- MULTICORE SYSTEMS

Development of the concept of accelerating the operation of systems through parallel multi-threaded programming. This area is rapidly gaining momentum.

- ROBOTS and PRODUCTION AUTOMATION.

It is a purely practical sphere, directly related to the industrial use of software developments, and therefore the most mastered since the 80s of the last century.

- CREATION OF VIRTUAL REALITY SYSTEMS

That's where psychology and programming intersect most tightly. Ideally, work in this direction can bear fruit in the form of the emergence of new training systems.

- SYSTEM MODELING (CAD/CAM)

Engineering discipline, whose specialists are in high demand for solving problems of purely practical communication tasks, and it does not matter whether it is network communication, gas pipe or water supply.

- COMPUTER GRAPHICS

Solves an urgent range of issues related to developments in the field of accelerating graphics processing in computer systems, as well as improving color rendering.

# Conclusion

** Programming moves science, which moves technological progress. Inventions that were considered revolutionary yesterday serve everyday needs in the XXI century: Microwave oven, mobile phone, 8-bit home computer. It depends on the programmer-scientist which peaks science will reach today and which of them will enter every home tomorrow.**
**In the hands of a programmer-scientist there are tools not only for the development of industry, but also for improving the overall quality of life. Such a specialist increases the prognostic function of humanity, helping to anticipate and prevent climatic, financial, humanitarian disasters.**
