# Advantages

- Constant work on self-improvement, knowledge of your tao, the way of a warrior.
- Working with very advanced people, meeting with colleagues who understand you perfectly.
- Work at normal computers, in a harmless environment.
- Participation in the life of the country — "real", not "TV".
- The opportunity to earn as much as you like, if you don't want to — downshift.
- Permanent professional conferences, seminars, meetings.
- There is a high probability of changing several countries of residence and continents.
- The probability of living an interesting and long life, because a loaded brain ages more slowly.
- There is always an opportunity to retrain, to teach someone. Even in retirement.
- As a rule, a positive outlook on the future.

# Disadvantages:

- The need for the first time, almost 2-3 years, to be at a tedious job or to be picked up in a large team.
- Constant inactivity, which you need to fight.
- Problems with blood circulation and nerves in the fourth decade of life. Dry eye syndrome can overtake in two to three years.
- Difficulty in choosing worthy managers.
- The risk of making a mistake in choosing a subject area that you will devote considerable time to studying.
- Fixed costs for upgrading the computer.
- Changing the subject area can lead to a return to the starting point of a career.
- Condemnation and misunderstanding of others when communicating on topics close to programming.

# Bottom line

Our virtues are a continuation of our shortcomings, but the virtues are so weighty that they will be enough for more than one good career.
