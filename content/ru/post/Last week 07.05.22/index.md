## Обзор
1. На прошлой неделе мне удалось запустить свой веб-сайт благодаря генератору статистических веб-сайтов Hugo. И он прямо перед твоими глазами! *** Круто, не правда ли?***
2. Мне также удалось выполнить две лабораторные работы по предмету "Операционные системы": основы интерфейса взаимодействия пользователя с системой Unix на уровне командной строки и работа с отчетами в Markdown.
